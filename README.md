My main interest in programming is building scalable web applications.

I primarily use C, javascript languages (NextJS) because I enjoy the challenge of turning complex ideas into working, efficient solutions.

My philosophy is centered on user experience. I see myself as a curious problem-solver who is always eager to learn the next big thing in machine learning.
